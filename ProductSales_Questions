Task1: Cleaning the bad data:---------------


For orders table:
 - Eliminate duplicate 'order_id' to prevent double-counting in data analysis.
 - Convert the data type of 'product_id' from number to Text.
 - To address data entry issues, replace the incorrect entries in the 'qty' field that end with "Q" and append the corrected values as necessary.
 - Substitute any empty values in the 'qty' column with the text 'Not Available'.

For the products table:
 - Remove all the extra leading and trailing spaces in product_name. (Hint: use TRIM() function)
 - split the 'price (in Rs)' column at the 'â‚¹' symbol and extract the numerical values. 
   Rename the columns appropriately after completing this task.

For the customer table:
 - Convert all customer names to lowercase.
 - Copy all customer name values, then paste them permanently using 'Paste Special' -> 'Values'.


Task2: Merging Data---------------

Note: Before writing the formula, ensure to change the cell type to 'General'
1. Use the VLOOKUP() function to retrieve all the customer names that correspond to their respective 'customer_id' listed in the orders table.
2. Use the INDEX-MATCH() function to retrieve all the product names that correspond to their respective 'product_id' listed in the orders table.
3. Use XLOOKUP() to obtain the corresponding 'price (in Rs)' of the products listed in the orders table.
4. Create a new column named "total_price" in the orders table that calculates the product of 'qty' and 'price (in INR)'
